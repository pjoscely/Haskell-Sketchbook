Problem 42
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values
 we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. 
 If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand 
common English words, how many are triangle words?

words.txt = ["A","ABILITY","ABLE","ABOUT","ABOVE","ABSENCE","ABSOLUTELY","ACADEMIC",
       "ACCEPT","ACCESS","ACCIDENT","ACCOMPANY","ACCORDING","ACCOUNT","ACHIEVE",
       "ACHIEVEMENT","ACID","ACQUIRE","ACROSS","ACT","ACTION","ACTIVE","ACTIVITY",
       "ACTUAL","ACTUALLY","ADD","ADDITION","ADDITIONAL","ADDRESS","ADMINISTRATION",
       "ADMIT","ADOPT","ADULT","ADVANCE","ADVANTAGE","ADVICE","ADVISE","AFFAIR","AFFECT",...,
       ..., ,"WRITE","WRITER","WRITING","WRONG","YARD","YEAH","YEAR","YES","YESTERDAY",
