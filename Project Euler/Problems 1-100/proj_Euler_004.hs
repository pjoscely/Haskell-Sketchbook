-- Largest palindrome product
    
-- Problem 4
-- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit -- numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

-- Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

-- One line list comprehension using show, which converts a numeric value into a string.
ans :: Integer
ans = maximum [ (x*y)|x<- [100..999],y<- [100..999], reverse(show(x*y)) == show (x*y)] 

-- ans = 906609
